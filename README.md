### How to install and use


#### Selenium and webdriver

In order to run tests with selenium, you either need to have a webbrowser installed on your machine and a webdriver.

If you do the development on Window, you might need to install a (Firefox) webdriver: gecko driver, found at: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases

Beside that, simply do `pip install -r requirements.txt` and the needed Selenium package will be installed.
